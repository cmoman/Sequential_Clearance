git branch # lists the branchs and puts an asterisk beside them.

within WingIDE you need to add a file before you commit it.

git commit - m changed_file.py # commits the change to the local repository
git push ... # will need to add some references here like which repo to push too git@github.com:cmoman/Sequential_Clearance.git

git mv file_name.py file_name_foo.py  # changes the name, this doesn't seem to get noticed as a change to merge on github.

git fetch ...# gets changes from github
git pull ...# seems not sure.

you can set up a pull request on github to merge changes back into the master directory.
